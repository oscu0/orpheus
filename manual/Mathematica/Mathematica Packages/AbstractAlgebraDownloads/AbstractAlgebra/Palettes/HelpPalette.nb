are a number of other sections that open up to a variety of palettes. Each \
palette section can be opened or closed by clicking on the triangle that \
toggles the palette open or closed.  Each section is a list of function names \
with boxes for the parameters of each function. Each solid box (\
\[SelectionPlaceholder]) becomes filled with whatever is selected at the time \
the button is pressed; if nothing was selected, the function name is pasted \
with this box selected so that it can be filled by typing or using another \
button. Whenever there is another empty box (\[Placeholder]), this parameter \
also needs to be filled in. Some of the functions may have an alternate \
syntax than what is given here; typing ?function_name will clarify what type \
of parameters are expected for each function. Of course, you can also use the \
Help Browser at any time for more definitive information about any function. \
