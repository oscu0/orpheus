Welcome to AbstractAlgebra

This Mathematica package needs to be installed in its proper location. Install the whole AbstractAlgebra folder (directory) in your base directory inside the Applications folder. If you don't know what this is, please consult the TestInstallation notebook included.  This gives a Mathematica command that tells you where to install this directory and how to do so. It also gives additional information to test to make sure it is properly installed.

If you already know how to install packages, you likely won't read that file (nor perhaps this one). However, the Learn More section contained within this file has some new features to the AbstractAlgebra package and it may be worth considering this. Also, after installing the package and restarting Mathematica, be sure to consult the AbstractAlgebra palette under the Palettes menu. This may be quite useful both for the 175 commands embedded there but also the various links to other resources and calculators.

Enjoy. If you have questions or comments, please contact either of us.
