Welcome to AbstractAlgebra

This Mathematica package needs to be installed in its proper location. \
Install the whole AbstractAlgebra folder (directory) in your base directory \
inside the Applications folder. If you don't know what this is, please \
consult the TestInstallation notebook included.  This gives a Mathematica \
command that tells you where to install this directory and how to do so. It \
also gives additional information to test to make sure it is properly \
installed.

If you already know how to install packages, you likely won't read that file \
(nor perhaps this one). However, the Learn More section contained within this \
file has some new features to the AbstractAlgebra package and it may be worth \
considering this. Also, after installing the package and restarting \
Mathematica, be sure to consult the AbstractAlgebra palette under the \
Palettes menu. This may be quite useful both for the 175 commands embedded \
there but also the various links to other resources and calculators.

Enjoy. If you have questions or comments, please contact either of us.
