 " introduced a function called Symmetric, which conflicts with the name \

to work as a groupoid for positive integer arguments and as the System \
function for lists.\n\nThe FilterOptions package used in previous version is \
no longer supported and is superseded by FilterRules, which is a System \
function.  This is reflected in version of the package.\n\nOne nagging \
problem:  Options to Symmetric work fine, but show up in red because the \
System version of Symmetric has no options.  I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m not sure \
how to fix that.\n\nChanged LabCode.m to remove FilterOptions and BarCharts \
in BeginPackage.\n\nChanged some option names in the BarChart function: \
BarLabels changed to ChartLabels, BarValues removed, and BarStyle to \
ChartStyle.\n\nIn LabCode.m, changed Global`e to just e in some definitions \
