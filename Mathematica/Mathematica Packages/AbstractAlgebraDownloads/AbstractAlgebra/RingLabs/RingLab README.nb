                    Mathematica-Compatible Notebook

This notebook can be used with any Mathematica-compatible
application, such as Mathematica, MathReader or Publicon. The data
for the notebook starts with the line containing stars above.

To get the notebook into a Mathematica-compatible application, do
one of the following:

* Save the data starting with the line of stars above into a file
  with a name ending in .nb, then open the file inside the
  application;

* Copy the data starting with the line of stars above to the
  clipboard, then use the Paste menu command inside the application.

Data for notebooks contains only printable 7-bit ASCII and can be
sent directly in email or through ftp in text mode.  Newlines can be
CR, LF or CRLF (Unix, Macintosh or MS-DOS style).

NOTE: If you modify the data for this notebook not in a Mathematica-
compatible application, you must delete the line below containing
the word CacheID, otherwise Mathematica-compatible applications may
try to use invalid cache data.

applications, contact Wolfram Research:
